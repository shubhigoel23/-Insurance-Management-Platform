When creating a new Spring Boot project, you can use the Spring Initializr to generate a new project with the required dependencies already included. 
The dependencies that are included depend on the features you select when generating the project, but some common dependencies that are included by default are:

spring-boot-starter-web: This dependency includes everything you need to create a web application with Spring Boot, including the Spring MVC framework,
 Tomcat as the default embedded container, and support for various data formats such as JSON and XML.

spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: This dependency includes everything you need to work with databases using the Java Persistence API (JPA), including Hibernate as the 
default JPA implementation, and a database driver for your selected database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle).

spring-boot-starter-test: This dependency includes everything you need to write and run tests for your Spring Boot application, including JUnit, Mockito, and the 
Spring Test Framework.

spring-boot-starter-security: This dependency includes everything you need to secure your Spring Boot application, including Spring Security and support for various 
authentication and authorization mechanisms.

spring-boot-starter-actuator: This dependency includes everything you need to monitor and manage your Spring Boot application in production, including health checks, 
metrics, and endpoints for monitoring and management.

These are just a few of the most common dependencies that are included in a Spring Boot project by default. You can add or remove dependencies as needed for your 
specific application requirements.

Requirements:
1. Set up a new Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) and
select the necessary dependencies (e.g., Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and an
embedded database like H2 or Apache Derby).
2. Create the necessary domain models and their relationships:
a. Client: Represents a client with properties such as name, date of birth, address,
and contact information.
b. InsurancePolicy: Represents an insurance policy with properties like policy
number, type, coverage amount, premium, start date, and end date. Each policy
should be associated with a client.
c. Claim: Represents an insurance claim with properties like claim number,
description, claim date, and claim status. Each claim should be associated with
an insurance policy.
3. Implement RESTful APIs for the following actions:
a. Clients:
i. GET /api/clients: Fetch all clients.
ii. GET /api/clients/{id}: Fetch a specific client by ID.
iii. POST /api/clients: Create a new client.
iv. PUT /api/clients/{id}: Update a client's information.
v. DELETE /api/clients/{id}: Delete a client.
b. Insurance Policies:
i. GET /api/policies: Fetch all insurance policies.
ii. GET /api/policies/{id}: Fetch a specific insurance policy by ID.
iii. POST /api/policies: Create a new insurance policy.
iv. PUT /api/policies/{id}: Update an insurance policy.
v. DELETE /api/policies/{id}: Delete an insurance policy.
c. Claims:
i. GET /api/claims: Fetch all claims.
ii. GET /api/claims/{id}: Fetch a specific claim by ID.
iii. POST /api/claims: Create a new claim.
iv. PUT /api/claims/{id}: Update a claim's information.
v. DELETE /api/claims/{id}: Delete a claim.
4. Use Spring Data JPA to create repositories for the domain models and interact with the
embedded database or mysql
5. Implement exception handling and validation to ensure proper API usage and data
integrity.
